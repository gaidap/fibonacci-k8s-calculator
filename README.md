# Overly complex Fibonacci Calculator
This a learning project with an on purpose over-engineered approach on an fibonacci calculator, to learn
and demonstrate how to deploy a very complex app with multiple components in docker.

## My disclaimer
Be warned this is only a learning project. All code residing in this project and or repo is my attempt to learn docker. So it is possible that some code maybe not best practice or standard.
